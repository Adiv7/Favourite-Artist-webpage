        <p>💜A.R.M.Y / 아미: BTS's official fanclub name, also known as the BTS ARMY amongst western media. A.R.M.Y is an acronym for Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth. ARMY also represents a military and because 방탄소년단 directly translates to “Bulletproof
            Boy Scouts,” ARMY (military) and BTS (the armor) would always be together.💜

                <p>BTS and A.R.M.Y are almost mirrored images of each other and they have a relationship that is affected by each other. The symbol of A.R.M.Y is expressed as a door on their viewpoint who is waiting & welcoming BTS on the opposite door when
                    BTS opens a new door.</p>
